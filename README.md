Raindrops
=========

*Raindrops will fall down the screen in a set interval.

*There will be a catcher at the bottom to catch the falling raindrops.

*A score keeper will keep track of how many raindrops are caught.

*If three raindrops are missed, the screen will turn black and read "game over" signaling the ends of the game.
